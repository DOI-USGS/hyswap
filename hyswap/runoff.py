    site_col : str
        Column in geom_intersection_df with drainage area site numbers.

    geom_id_col : str
        Column in geom_intersection_df with geometry ids.

    prop_geom_in_basin_col : str
        Name of column with values (type:float) representing the proportion
        (0 to 1) of the spatial geometry occurring in the corresponding

        percentage = True. If the values are decimal proportions,
        percentage = False. Default: False

    clip_downstream_basins : boolean, optional
        When True, the function estimates runoff using only basins that are
        (a) contained within the geometry and (b) the smallest basin
        containing the geometry in the weighted average. When False,
        the function uses all overlapping basins to estimate runoff
        for the geometry. Defaults to True.

    full_overlap_threshold : float, optional
        The minimum proportion of overlap between geometry and basin that
        constitutes "full" overlap. For example, occasionally a geometry
        (or basin) may be completely contained by a basin (or geometry),
        but polygon border artifacts might cause the intersection to be
        slightly less than 1. This input accounts for that error.
        Defaults to 0.98.

        column filled with runoff data.

    geom_intersection_df : pandas.DataFrame
        Tabular dataFrame containing columns indicating the site numbers,
        geometry ids, proportion of geometry in basin, and proportion
        of basin within geometry.

    site_col : str
        Column in geom_intersection_df with drainage area site numbers.
        Please make sure ids have the correct number of digits
        and have not lost leading 0s when read in. If the site
        numbers are the geom_intersection_df index col, site_col = 'index'.

    geom_id_col : str
        Column in geom_intersection_df with geometry ids.

    prop_geom_in_basin_col : str
        Name of column with values (type:float) representing the proportion
        (0 to 1) of the spatial geometry occurring in the corresponding
        drainage area. Default name: 'pct_in_basin'

    prop_basin_in_geom_col : str
        Name of column with values (type:float) representing the proportion
        (0 to 1) of the drainage area occurring in the corresponding
        spatial geometry. Default name: 'pct_in_huc'

    percentage : boolean, optional
        If the values in geom_intersection_df are percentages,
        percentage = True. If the values are decimal proportions,
        percentage = False. Default: False

    clip_downstream_basins : boolean, optional
        When True, the function estimates runoff using only basins that are
        (a) contained within the geometry and (b) the smallest basin
        containing the geometry in the weighted average. When False,
        the function uses all overlapping basins to estimate runoff
        for the geometry. Defaults to True.

    full_overlap_threshold : float, optional
        The minimum proportion of overlap between geometry and basin that
        constitutes "full" overlap. For example, occasionally a geometry
        (or basin) may be completely contained by a basin (or geometry),
        but polygon border artifacts might cause the intersection to be
        slightly less than 1. This input accounts for that error.
        Defaults to 0.98.
