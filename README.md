## Overview

`hyswap` (HYdrologic Surface Water Analysis Package), is a Python package which provides a set of functions for manipulating and visualizing USGS water data.
Specifically, a number of functions for calculating statistics (e.g., exceedance probabilities, daily historic percentiles) and generating related plots (e.g., flow duration curves, streamflow duration hydrographs) are available.
These methods are provided in a modular fashion as individual functions, and are designed to give the user flexibility in implementation.

### Project Documentation

For more information, visit the `hyswap` [documentation](https://doi-usgs.github.io/hyswap/).

## Installation

### User Installation via `pip`

One-liner to install `hyswap` via `pip`:

```bash
pip install hyswap
```

*Note:* `hyswap` has 4 dependencies right now, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`, these will be installed automatically when installing the package via `pip`.

### User Installation From Source

To install `hyswap` from source, first you will need to clone the repository.
Next, from the root of the repository, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

### Developer Installation

Developer installation should be performed from source.
First you will need to clone the repository.
Next, from the root of the repository, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Testing and Building Documentation Locally

To test the code and building and test the documentation locally, you must have cloned the source repository, follow the instructions above for a "developer installation" first.

To test the package locally, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
pytest
```

To build the documentation locally, run the following commands from the root of the repository:

```bash
cd docs
make docs
```

### Running the Linting and Formatting Checks Locally

To run the linting and formatting checks locally, run the following commands from the root of the repository:

```bash
flake8 .
pydocstringformatter .
```
### Running the Example Workflow Notebooks

The example Jupyter (.ipynb) notebooks contain extended use cases of `hyswap` functions. They are displayed in the [documentation pages](https://doi-usgs.github.io/hyswap/examples/index.html#example-workflow-notebooks), or you may download the notebooks from the 'example_notebooks' folder in this repository. The notebooks sometimes utilize additional packages that are not required to run the `hyswap` functions in isolation. You can use the developer installation instructions to create an environment containing all of the required packages to run the notebooks. Don't forget to also ``pip install hyswap`` into your working environment!
